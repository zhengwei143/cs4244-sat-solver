# CDCL SAT Solver

The algorithm for this CDCL SAT Solver follows the description of Algorithm 1 on page 6 of [https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/CIS673/sat-cdcl.pdf] fairly closely. 

Several design and implementation choices were made in consideration of memory and time efficiencies. The rationales for each choice are detailed below.

## Formula encoding




## Unit Propagation
